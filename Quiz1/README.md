# Patient Monitoring 

## Goal 
Make a program about monitoring patients

## Requirements
1. Patients in an intensive-care ward in a hospital are monitored by electronic analog devices attached to their bodies by sensors of various kinds.
2. Through the sensors the devices measure the patientsâ€™ vital factors: one device measure pulse rate, another blood pressure, another temperature, and so on.
3. A program is needed to read the factors, at a frequency specified for each patient, and store them in a database. 
4. The factors read are to be compared with safe ranges specified for each patient, and readings that exceed the safe ranges are to be reported by alarm messages displayed on screen of the nurses station. An alarm message is also to be displayed if any analog device falls.
